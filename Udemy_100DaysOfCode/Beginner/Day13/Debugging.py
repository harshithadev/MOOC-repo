# 1. describe/ understand the problem statement properly 
# 2. reproduce the bug : see what replicates or causes the bug, this will help you eradicate the bug
# 3. play computer : manually see the execution flow, and then you might see what is wrong where
# 4. Print is your frind : everytime you get answers you arent expcting, high chance is that there is some sort of miscalculation happening 
# so apply print statements along the execution flow to find out the bug
# 5. Fix the error : anything red or the run time errors, the errors mostly tell you what is wrong. But sometimes when there are 1000s of lines and it dosnt 
# indicate the line in which the error exists, the smarted solution would be to google the error and see what causes it. 
# that would narrow down the possibilities of the error occurence search by so much. 
# 6. Use a debugger : online debuggers exist. example : 
# 7. take a break : it dosnt help that you are constantly staring at the screen. Sometimes we tend to see things monotoneously, when we take a break, we might see the problem from a different perspective and realise the bug
# 8. Ask for help : If you are in deadlocks with a big/problem, there is a high chance that someone has already been there or atleast been in a similar situation/bug/problem and might have found a way out of it or might had help getting out of it. 
# so why wait till your head explodes? google it. Stack overflow is godsent for programmers.
# 9. run the program frequently, even before you type the whole thing.
# 10. Raise a problem/ issue : If none of the above steps work for you, if you've exhausted all of them then feel free to raise a query. The internet is filled with developers/ programmers ready to help
